## Einstein Engines

Einstein Engines is a hard fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), built around the ideals and design inspirations of the Baystation family of servers, with a focus on having modular code that anyone can use to make the RP server of their dreams. Our founding organization is based on a democratic system whereby our mutual contributors and downstreams have a say in what code goes into their own upstream. If you are a representative of a former downstream of DeltaV, I would like to invite you to contact us for an opportunity to represent your fork in this new upstream.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

As a Hard Fork, any code sourced from a different upstream cannot ever be merged directly here, and must instead be ported. All code present in this repository is subject to change as desired by the council of maintainers.

## "Official Server Policy"
#### No Official Servers will ever be made for Einstein-Engines.

In order to prevent a potential conflict of interest, we will never open any server directly using the Einstein-Engines upstream itself. Any server claiming to be an official representation of this fork is not endorsed in any way by this organization. We however would like to invite anyone wishing to create a server to make a fork of Einstein-Engines.

## Documentation/Wiki

The [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. It has lots of resources for new contributors to the project.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Since this repository is its own upstream, there is no code in this repository that is restricted from modification, and no markers are required to indicate where changes are made. 

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
3. Compile the solution.
